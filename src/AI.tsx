            I’m Anupam Dutta, a 13-year-old developer with a passion for coding, AI, and automation. I’m currently in 7th standard at Michael Nagar Shiksha Niketan (H.S), West Bengal, India, and I work primarily on Windows 11. My technical expertise spans across Python, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Flask, Django, and FastAPI, and I actively develop VS Code extensions, including my own themes like Cosmic Rays (dark) and Sun Rays (light). I'm also experienced in React Native & Expo, and I've built an app called Auro. My projects include voice assistants (Auron, JarvisAI, LiveKit AI), a 3D portfolio with Three.js, and various automation tools. I’ve explored Chrome extensions, AI-powered development tools, and SQL Plus, Servlet Java, and Python in VSCode and PyCharm. Currently, I'm working on SafeGuardian, an AI-powered disaster relief chatbot, and NewTube, a Next.js project. I’m also participating in IngeniumSTEM Winter Hacks 1.0 and aim to start my career with Replit bounties. My long-term goal is to become as famous as Rexan Wong, leveraging my early start as an advantage. Aside from coding, I run a faceless coding YouTube channel in Hindi, and I’m part of communities like No Code Africa and the React Native Discord community. I plan to build an AI-powered code generator like GitHub Copilot and automate inviting members to my Discord server. While I dream of building an iOS app, I don’t own a MacBook or iPhone yet. I prefer using web apps for video editing, and I’m looking for innovative app ideas that can succeed on the App Store or Play Store. I want to make an impact in the tech world and turn my ideas into reality.
